# Stocksim
stock market simulator and AI stock trader



The stock simulator is a (simple) GUI that allows you to set many parameters before beginging the simulation. Once the parameters have been set, simulator will run and generate some arbitrarily large number of simulated rounds. The AI-trader will sort through all of the unlablled data in order to find the correlated stocks and the magnitude of the correlation.
