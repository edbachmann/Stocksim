# Stocksim
stock market simulator and AI stock trader



The stock simulator is a (simple) GUI that allows you to set many parameters before beginging the simulation. Once the parameters have been set, simulator will run and the AI-trader will try to predict the best possible stock picks for each round. The solver program will run and identify the actual optimal stock moves in order to train the AI. With this set-up, we can quickly experiment with many different stock market models and conditions.
